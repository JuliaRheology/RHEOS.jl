    "There may be situations when it is appropriate to focus the model fitting process on particular regions of the data. This may occur, for example, when the small time scale loading region is of particular interest. To achieve this, we could send data to fit that is sampled variably, with a greater sample density near the region of interest. However, the variable sampling rate means that the method RHEOS uses to compute the model predictions is slower and less accurate."
