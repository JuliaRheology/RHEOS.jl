    "Next, we will fit a fractional Maxwell (spring) model (the only difference from the above model is that the dash-pot is replaced by a spring-pot). This time we will also add upper and lower bounds on the model parameters. This is highly recommended for fractional models in particular as values less than 0 or greater than 1 for the spring-pot parameter are unphysical and can cause errors in the Mittag-Leffler function used (more information about the fractional models in review TBA). To facilitate the convergence of the fitting algorithm, it is also suggested to define an initial set of parameters (the function uses 0.5 for all parameters not defined). For initial parameters, lower bounds and upper bounds, it is possible to only specify some of the parameters and the rest will be filled in automatically."

This enables the modulus to be used directly for the fitting, which vastly reduces the computational burden. For this reason, RHEOS provides a dedicated function `modelstepfit` that requires the same parameters as `modelfit`. If this assumption is appropriate for the data then fitting can be sped up greatly by use of this function."
